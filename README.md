# Lambda-Calculus

This project was inspired by my Fundies I lab TA. The very last lab of the course was like a free-for-all and he offered to teach us lambda calculus -- only 3 of us participated.
He challenged us to recreate his project that redefined the factorial function and its components and/or expand upon it.

Theoretically, everything can be defined as functions within functions! Thus, this project is the redefining of basic math functions to only using lambdas!

Instead of aiming for a simple recreation of my TA's project to redefine the factorial function based on memory,
I redefined the basic mathematical function that computes the n-th number of the Fibonacci Sequence to honor my interest in golden-ratio related topics.
